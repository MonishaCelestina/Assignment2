  **Acknowledgements**
  We got the inspiration for the webstie layout from Swee Lee

**Reflection**
It was fun to be able to create pages as well as styling the design. We stumbled upon errors along the way of creating and designing the pages but we figured it out and worked as much as we can to ensure that the pages runs smoothly and the design and layout looks great on the website.
