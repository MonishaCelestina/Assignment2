**Additional Errors faced**

- Spotify API suddenly had stopped working. The error was caused by the refresh access token not being found. This was due to
  trying to refresh the access token in the local storage, however, the local storage had no access token. Therefore, I decided to generate my own access token instead of refreshing it

  **Acknowledgements**
  We got the inspiration for the webstie layout from Swee Lee https://www.sweelee.com.sg/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAt5euBhB9EiwAdkXWO5q8A8k4xGJ6d6CyhAXqPfCrD2M4UvrAgtVdK0UQMe5dYm3J932ATxoC9ysQAvD_BwE

**Reflection**
It was fun to be able to create pages as well as styling the design. We stumbled upon errors along the way of creating and designing the pages but we figured it out and worked as much as we can to ensure that the pages runs smoothly and the design and layout looks great on the website.
